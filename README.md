# Time-Series-Analysis

Each notebook contains theory and exercises completed by me as part of a time series course, designed to learn and apply:

1. **Basic Statistical Models**:  
   - ETS decomposition, EWMA, and Holt-Winters to analyze trend, seasonality, and noise components.

2. **Analysis and Tests**:  
   - Descriptive statistics, ACF, PACF, and stationarity tests.

3. **Classic Models**:  
   - AR, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX for univariate data forecasting.

4. **Multivariate Models**:  
   - VAR and VARMA for time series with multiple variables.

5. **Forecasting Exercises**:  
   - Selection of ARIMA orders and solving real-world forecasting problems using various models.

These exercises enhanced my understanding and application of key techniques in time series analysis and forecasting.
